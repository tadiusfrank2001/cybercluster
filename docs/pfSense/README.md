# 🔐 pfSense Firewall Configuration

## Overview

`pfSense` is a powerful open-source firewall and router operating system built on FreeBSD. It provides essential security services such as:

- Stateful packet filtering
- Network Address Translation (NAT)
- VPN support
- Intrusion Detection/Prevention (with tools like Snort)
- Web-based management interface

In this cyber lab, pfSense acts as the **central gateway and firewall**, connecting isolated internal networks to the external internet while enforcing traffic segmentation, logging, and intrusion detection.

## 🖥️ VM Configuration

- **Hypervisor**: UTM (macOS)
- **ISO**: `pfSense-CE-X.Y.Z-RELEASE-amd64.iso`
- **Resources**:
  - 4 GB RAM
  - 8 GB virtual disk
- **Network Adapters** (3 total):
  - `em0`: **WAN** – NAT/Shared Adapter (DHCP)
  - `em1`: **LAN1** – Emulated VLAN Internal Network 1 (192.168.100.1/24)
  - `em2`: **LAN2** – Emulated VLAN Internal Network 2 (192.168.101.1/24)

## 🔧 Installation Steps

1. Booted from pfSense ISO installer.
2. Selected:
   - Partition: Entire disk (UFS)
   - Partition scheme: GPT
3. Completed installation and rebooted.
4. Removed ISO media to avoid reinstall loop.

## 🔌 Interface Assignment on Pfsense

1. Select the appropriate number on the Pfesense CLI for setting **Interface Assignments**

3. Set the following configs for each interface:
   
- **WAN** → `em0` (NAT to host for internet access)
- **LAN1** → `em1` (192.168.100.1/24)
- **LAN2** → `em2` (192.168.101.1/24)
- VLAN tagging: **Disabled**

## 🌐 IP Configuration

1. Select the appropriate number on the Pfesense CLI for setting **IP Configuration**

2. Set the following configs for each interface:

### LAN1 Interface (`em1`)
- **Static IP**: `192.168.100.1/24`
- **DHCP Range**: `192.168.100.2` – `192.168.100.100`

### LAN2 Interface (`em2`)
- **Static IP**: `192.168.101.1/24`
- **DHCP Range**: `192.168.101.2` – `192.168.100.100`

### WAN Interface (`em0`)
- **DHCP from Host Network**

---

## 🚫 IPv6 Settings

- IPv6 configuration **disabled** on LAN interfaces
- No DHCPv6 or RA responses accepted

---

## 🔥 Firewall Rules

- **Default Rules** applied at first boot
- Custom rules added for:
  - LAN-to-WAN access control
  - Intra-LAN segmentation (optional)
  - Snort IDS packet inspection

---

## 🛡️ Snort Integration

- Snort is installed and configured on pfSense
- Used for real-time packet inspection and alerting
- Ruleset tuned for internal lab monitoring
