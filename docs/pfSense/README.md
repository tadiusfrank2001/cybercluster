# üîê pfSense Firewall Configuration

## Overview

`pfSense` is a powerful open-source firewall and router operating system built on FreeBSD. It provides essential security services such as:

- Stateful packet filtering
- Network Address Translation (NAT)
- VPN support
- Intrusion Detection/Prevention (with tools like Snort)
- Web-based management interface

In this cyber lab, pfSense acts as the **central gateway and firewall**, connecting isolated internal networks to the external internet while enforcing traffic segmentation, logging, and intrusion detection.
