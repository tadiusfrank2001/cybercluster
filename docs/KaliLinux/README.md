# 💀 Kali Linux (Attacker VM)

## 📄 Overview

Kali Linux is a Debian-based, open-source distribution built specifically for **penetration testing**, **digital forensics**, and **ethical hacking**. It includes powerful tools like:

- 🛠️ Metasploit Framework
- 🛰️ Nmap
- 🔍 Wireshark
- 🔓 Burp Suite
- and many more...

In this cyber lab, Kali Linux acts as the **attacker system**, used to simulate real-world offensive operations. It targets vulnerable machines like Metasploitable2 and interacts with security infrastructure (e.g., pfSense and Snort) to trigger and validate detection events.
