# ðŸŽ¯ Metasploitable2 (Target VM)

## Overview

`Metasploitable2` is a purposefully vulnerable Linux-based virtual machine developed by Rapid7. Itâ€™s widely used as a sandbox for:

- Practicing offensive security techniques
- Testing IDS/IPS detection capabilities
- Simulating real-world exploitation scenarios

In this cyber lab, Metasploitable2 acts as the **victim machine** on an isolated internal network, allowing structured attacks from Kali Linux and monitoring via Snort on pfSense.
